# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

## Welcome!

This is a solution to the Loopstudios landing page challenge by Frontend Mentor.

I took part in this challenge to test my HTML and CSS skills compare to those of junior professionals. My solution was developed in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript (without any libraries or frameworks). This not only allows me comprehensively test my ability to work with those tools, but also my level of understanding in the technologies as well.
